# Adjutable Walk Speed

Adjustable Walk Speed is a quality of life mod for The Long Dark. 

It allows players to adjust the walk speed (and only the walk speed) of your character for some more cinematic and immersive moments. 
Scroll down to decrease walk speed to 30% of the normal walk speed and scroll up to increase it back up to the full walk speed. You cannot increase the speed more than the standard walk speed to move faster.
